# Production issue review record

Production baseline: MorphCook 1.6.0+10, original `claude-fable-5/app`.
The app source matches `morphcook-refined` v1.6.0 (9a31020), which F-Droid
builds. Other benchmark implementations are outside this work.

## Issue 6 — website recipe imports

Cookbook → link icon → paste a recipe URL → load → choose a recipe → review
and save. The imported text and optional photo are stored locally. Photos are
off by default; a failed photo download permits importing text alone. Source
attribution is retained. Imported recipes do not acquire verified diet,
allergy or nutrition labels. Ambiguous amounts remain original text with an
explicit indication that they do not scale.

Regression coverage: website parser/network limits, attribution round trips,
review/cancel/save, photo opt-in/fallback/cache, raw amounts throughout cooking
and shopping, and compatibility with existing personal recipes.

Reviewers: `review6_a`, `release_audit`, `web_import`. All approved after
iterations addressing ambiguous/compound quantities, expansion limits,
metadata allocation, and unscaled-amount labeling. The latter two reviewers
had contributed separate implementation portions; each independently reviewed
the complete diff and raised findings in integration authored by others.
`review6_a` additionally tested real Allrecipes HTML and confirmed the
expansion regression fails when its protection is disabled.

Validation: Flutter 3.38.3 analysis clean; full suite 211 passing tests;
20 parser tests passed after strengthening the expansion regression;
Android release APK builds successfully. Website availability remains subject
to the source site's access policy and published recipe data.

## Issue 7 — share recipes and cookbooks

Recipe details can share one recipe; the cookbook can share all saved and
personal recipes. Android receives one Bluetooth-compatible ZIP containing
readable recipe text and importable JSON. Photos are optional. Recipients
preview and confirm additions without replacing their profile, plans,
shopping list, cooking progress, or existing recipes. Duplicate imports are
idempotent and conflicting recipes/photos receive separate local copies.

Regression coverage: localized bundled recipes, source/raw-amount round trips,
photo opt-in, duplicate/conflict handling, persistence rollback, unrelated-data
preservation, bounded JSON/ZIP decoding, dense valid cookbooks, native share
files, cache lifetime, preview/cancel, and navigation during import.

Reviewers: `review6_a`, `release_audit`, `web_import`. All independently approved
the complete change after iterations covering Bluetooth MIME compatibility,
bounded archive inflation, receiver-copy lifetime, import navigation, and
pre-decode JSON limits that also accept the full valid format envelope.
Each reviewer contributed a separate implementation portion, disclosed that
contribution, and reviewed the complete integration and subsequent corrections.

Validation: Flutter 3.38.3 analysis clean; full suite 248 passing tests;
Android release APK built and installed. Android API 34 resolves the ZIP SEND
intent to its Bluetooth activity. Actual radio transfer requires a second
device and depends on the receiving device's available sharing apps.

## Issue 8 — manual, feedback, PDF imports and expert assessments

Settings includes a searchable offline English/German manual and a feedback
composer. Feedback opens an explicit GitHub draft for the user to submit, with
an offline clipboard fallback; it does not attach private app data. Cookbook
PDF import extracts selectable text locally on Android and opens editable
recipe drafts. Ambiguous layouts retain their complete source text for manual
entry. Scanned/protected PDFs and size limits have explicit explanations.

Recipe details offer a way to share a recipe for professional review and record
private, attributed assessments with qualifications, date, context and source.
These notes are included in full backups, excluded from recipe sharing, and
marked when the recipe changes. MorphCook supplies no professional reviews or
verified credentials and does not derive dietary or nutrition labels from notes.

Reviewers: `review6_a`, `release_audit`, `web_import`. All independently approved
the complete final change, including the release-only optional-decoder rule.
Each disclosed their separate implementation contribution (manual/feedback,
native PDF extraction/licensing, or PDF text parsing) and reviewed the complete
integration and corrections independently.

Corrective rounds addressed manual navigation state, private-note mutation
races during deletion/restore/reset, strict offscreen date validation, quadratic
heading/duration parsing, bounded ingredient continuations, native malformed-PDF
containment, required dependency notices, and PDFBox's optional JP2 decoder in
release shrinking. Every reported issue has regression coverage.

Validation: Flutter 3.38.3 analysis clean; all 299 Flutter tests pass. All 12
native Android API 34 tests pass using real generated PDFs, including embedded
Unicode, compressed text, scans, encryption/permissions, byte/page/text/operator
limits, scratch cleanup, deeply nested malformed content, and JPEG2000 paths
without an image decoder. The release APK builds and installs successfully;
all native license assets match their sources. A real release-APK smoke test
selected a compressed PDF through Android's picker, extracted the expected
ingredients/steps, reviewed its draft, saved it, and returned to the cookbook
with the new recipe. Native test commands are in `android/PDF_IMPORT_TESTS.md`.
